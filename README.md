This project aims to develop a forest fire detection system using IoT sensors. The system enables early detection of forest fires in Nepal, facilitating timely action and mitigation efforts.

## Introduction

In Nepal, forest fires pose a significant threat to the environment, wildlife, and communities. This project focuses on developing an IoT-based system that detects forest fires at an early stage. By utilizing IoT sensors, the system can monitor vast forest areas and provide real-time alerts when a fire is detected, enabling a prompt response and minimizing the damage caused by wildfires.

## Benefits

- Early Detection: The system quickly detects fires in large forest areas, allowing for timely action to be taken.
- Immediate Alerts: Authorities and local communities receive immediate alerts, enabling a rapid response to combat the fire.
- Quick Resource Mobilization: Early detection facilitates faster mobilization of firefighting resources, increasing the chances of containing and extinguishing the fire before it spreads further.
- Protection of Forests and Wildlife: By detecting fires early, the system helps minimize the damage caused by wildfires, preserving the natural environment and safeguarding wildlife habitats.
- Long-term Preservation: The system's proactive approach to fire detection contributes to the long-term preservation of Nepal's forests for future generations.
